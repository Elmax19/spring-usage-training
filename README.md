## MongoDB spring-data-starter

Spring Dataâ€™s mission is to provide a familiar and consistent, Spring-based programming model for data access while
still retaining the special traits of the underlying data store.

It makes it easy to use data access technologies, relational and non-relational databases, map-reduce frameworks, and
cloud-based data services. This is an umbrella project which contains many subprojects that are specific to a given
database. The projects are developed by working together with many of the companies and developers that are behind these
exciting technologies.

Spring Data for MongoDB is part of the umbrella Spring Data project which aims to provide a familiar and consistent
Spring-based programming model for new datastores while retaining store-specific features and capabilities.

The Spring Data MongoDB project provides integration with the MongoDB document database. Key functional areas of Spring
Data MongoDB are a POJO centric model for interacting with a MongoDB DBCollection and easily writing a Repository style
data access layer.
